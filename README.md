# AoBFoodTruck
Pet Project done as a response to the coding4employment challenge by JA Kenya

# BACKGROUND TO THE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM & CHALLENGE

Back in 2021, I registered and participated in the Coding4Employment(CfE) mentorship program facilitated by Junior Achievers(JA) Kenya. The trainings were around foundations of software development and IT Support fundamentals. As the process was ongoing, we had a challenge/hackathon week dubbed #CodingForEmploymentChallengeWeek

# BACKGROUND TO THE CHALLENGE/HACKATHON
Challenge: Assuming that you are the owner of an SME that ventures in a business of your choice. Make further assumptions on the same.

i. The SME has been in operation for over 1 year

ii. The SME needs to double its client base

iii. The SME currently has no online presence

The goal was to develop a basic three-page website that aims to not only increase awareness of the existence of your SME but also acts as an advertisement agent for your SME’s products and/or service.

For references, we used material found in the CfE website under the tabs Microsoft virtual Academy and Build Your Business
